Dataset: Diabetes 130-US hospitals for years 1999-2008 Data Set
<ul>
    <li>Data: Diabetic Encounters (1-14 days/each) from 130 Hospitals for 10 years (1999-2008) </li>
    <li>Goal: Predict if a diabetic patient will be readmitted to a hospital (less than 30 days, after 30 days, or never)</li>
    <li>Target Feature: readmitted </li>
</ul>


Additional Notes:
 - We modified the starter code by creating a separate module for preprocessing
